Assuming you want a basic minimal tattoo then you can choose any of our artists but if you are on a budget you can always prefer to choose an artist with 1-3 years of experience who does great basic work, and if you are looking for a super detailed piece then you also have the option to choose an experienced artist (over 5 years of experience).",
